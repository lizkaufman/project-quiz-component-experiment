# Experimenting - designing a quiz component

I experimented and worked out how to design a personality quiz component as part of our School of Code final project (and finally got my head around how to make a useReducer - hooray!).

The components from this repo have now been woven into the main project repo.

## To run:

- From VSCode: npm start (created with create-react-app)
- Online: https://volun-tinder-quiz-test.netlify.app/
