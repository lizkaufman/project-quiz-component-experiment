# Experimenting - designing a quiz component

I experimented and worked out how to design a personality quiz component as part of our School of Code final project. I've also used this as an opportunity to really get my head around how a useReducer works as I was still struggling a bit with it after class. I feel like I understand it now, and I can definitely see the benefits of controlling the state within a finite-state machine structure - hooray!

The components from this repo have now been woven into the main project repo.

## To run:

- From VSCode: npm start (created with create-react-app)
- Online: https://volun-tinder-quiz-test.netlify.app/
